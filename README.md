# TODO
### A basic web based todo list, with animated svg

# Sources
Giving props where props are due. I based my structure off of [Simo Edwin](https://github.com/developedbyed) YouTube tutorial and used icons from [IconMonstr](https://iconmonstr.com) to build out the design. 

You can watch Simo Edwin's tutorial [Here!](https://youtu.be/Ttf3CEsEwMQ)

## Instructions

To best use the TODO simply place the files on a server, or from your desktop and open the index.html in your favorite browser. Great to have in a seperate tab to keep tasks you need to complete for the day readily available. Simple clean and easy. 

Thank you and enjoy!
